In this assignment we constructed a doubly linked List in c++ where we have vertical cursor
to use to move around in our List. With the List we simulate a deck shuffle. We shuffle the deck
until it returns back to its orignal form.

Files:
List.cpp
List.h
ListTest.cpp
Shuffle.cpp
Makefile

To run:
download all files needed
type make in the teminal to 
make the executable.
Then "Shuffle <#of cards>"
