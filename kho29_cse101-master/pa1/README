Program:
This program takes in two arguments, a input file to read from and output file to output data to. 
This program's job is read in the strings from the input file and output it back in alphabetical order. 
It uses a doubly linked list to indirectly sort the strings it reads in. 
We make a list using the string's indcies and use those to sort the strings. 
It uses a cursor so move around the list to keep track of where we are in the list.

type make to make the executable Lex
then to run the program type "Lex <infile to read from> <outfile to output results to>"
