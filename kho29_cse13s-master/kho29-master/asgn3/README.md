In this assignment, we made sorting programs for four different types of algorithms. Heap, quick, shell, and insertion sorts. Our heap sort is using max heap, where we move the largest to the back and moves the smaller ones to the front. Each time we do this, we fix the heap. Quick sort chooses a pivot in the array, and if elements less than pivot moves left, if larger moves right. Shell sort sorts pairs that are gap distance apart. Insertion sort, checks one element at a time and moves them if they are less or bigger than the one being checked. 

To build program:
Download all the files needed.
Type make and 

To run the program:
./sorting [one or multiple inputs]
-a : Employs all sorting algorithms
-e : Enables Heap Sort.
-i : Enables Insertion Sort
-s : Enables Shell Sort
-q : Enables Quicksort
-r seed : Set the random seed to seed
-n size : Set the array size to size
-p elements : Print out elements number of elements from the array
-h to see the program's functions
