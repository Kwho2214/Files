Lab 2: Simple Data path

Description: 
In this lab, you will be building a register file that contains four, 4-bit registers. 
Each of the four registers has an address (0b00 -> 0b11) and stores a 4-bit value.
The value saved to a destination register (write register) will be chosen from one of two sources, 
the keypad user input, or the output of the ALU. The ALU in this system is a 4-bit bitwise left arithmetic shift circuit that takes 
two of the register values as inputs (read registers).
