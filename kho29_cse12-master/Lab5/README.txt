Lab 5: Functions and Graphics

Desciption:
In this lab, you will implement functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions will allow users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display. To simulate a display, we’ll be using the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS.
To do this you will utilize:
1. Arrays
2. Memory-mapped Input/Output (IO)
3. Subroutines (a.k.a. Functions or Procedures)
4. Macros


Files:
Lab5.asm
lab5_w21_test.asm
This is the assembly code of the program

Instructions:
To run this program, you need to download MARS, and Java if you don't already have it.
Open Mars and run Lab5
